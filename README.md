# CIS550_Project
This is a web application that facilitates user comparison of products sold on major shopping platforms including Temu, Shein, Amazon, and Walmart. A number of complex SQL queries will be utilized in order to provide the user with a set of tools that glean information about products, which ultimately empower the user to make an informed purchase.
Thus far, we have a basic React template in our repository, and this will eventually house the frontend component of our application.
